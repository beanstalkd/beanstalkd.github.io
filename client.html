<p>There is now a
<a href=https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/wiki/Client-Libraries>wiki page for
beanstalk clients</a> with a more up-to-date list of supported languages.</p>

<p>Or, make your own client API.
It's easy! The <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/master/doc/protocol.txt>protocol doc</a>
gives a complete description of the beanstalk protocol.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> as of version 1.0 the protocol will remain compatible until
beanstalkd 2.0. Any client written to work with a 1.x beanstalkd will also
work, unchanged, with any later beanstalkd before 2.0.</p>

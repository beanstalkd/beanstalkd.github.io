Beanstalk is a simple, fast work queue.

Its interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the latency
of page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks
asynchronously.

## Run It

First, run `beanstalkd` on one or more machines. There is no configuration
file and only a handful of command-line options.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./beanstalkd -l 10.0.1.5 -p 11300
{% endhighlight %}

This starts up `beanstalkd` listening on address 10.0.1.5, port 11300.
For more information on how to run beanstalkd as a background service,
in production, see [the adm directory][adm].

## Use It

Here's an example in Ruby -- see the [client libraries][] to find your
favorite language.

First, have one process put a job into the queue:

{% highlight ruby %}
beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
beanstalk.put('hello')
{% endhighlight %}

Then start another process to take jobs out of the queue and run them:

{% highlight ruby %}
beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
loop do
  job = beanstalk.reserve
  puts job.body # prints "hello"
  job.delete
end
{% endhighlight %}

## History

Philotic, Inc. developed beanstalk to improve the response time for the
[Causes on Facebook][cof] application (with over 9.5 million users). Beanstalk
decreased the average response time for the most common pages to a tiny
fraction of the original, significantly improving the user experience.
